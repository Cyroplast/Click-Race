Thank you.

STORY:
Red, a square who just turned 12, is a normal square in an amazing place called *The CPU*. 
One day, a virus comes and *destroys* the the computer he lives in.
Family and friends gone, he then decides to follow the virus through the internet, where they somehow get into the database center of the internet itself!
Red must find the virus between the thousands of computers , in the database center.
Oh and he has to race the computers' security agent, blue to pass the security guard exam since it is the only why to get in.
But its that simple, right?
